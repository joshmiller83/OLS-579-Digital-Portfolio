## Digital Portfolio for World Class Leadership (OLS-579)
This Digital Portfolio is part of the OLS 579: World-Class Leadership Strategies course. It's designed to help me synthesize and visualize the key leadership theories, principles, and practices I’m learning throughout the semester. The assignment isn’t just academic — it’s meant to serve as a personal artifact of growth and a professional reflection tool I can share with mentors, advisors, or potential employers.

For my submission, I'm building this portfolio using Slidev, a developer-friendly, Markdown-powered slide deck framework. My goals are twofold:

1. **Create a Referenceable, Web-Based Leadership Toolkit** <br>
I want this to become a living document I can return to — a concise, organized, and visually compelling reference of the leadership insights that have most influenced me. Each update will focus on ideas that shift how I lead and help me evolve from instinctual decision-making to strategy-backed leadership.

2. **Build with Tools That Fit My Workflow**<br>
As a web developer, I spend most of my time in code — not in PowerPoint. Slidev gives me the flexibility to build slides in Markdown, customize the design with web tech, and deploy online without the friction of traditional slide software. It also allows for versioning, portability, and future updates with ease.

Ultimately, I want this portfolio to feel professional but personal — something that reflects my identity, mindset, and ambition as a developing leader.

## Notes to Josh so he can duplicate this quickly in the future:

2. Clone the repo locally
3. `brew install npm pnpm`
4. `pnpm create slidev .`
5. Answer prompts
